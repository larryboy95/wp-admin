# wp-admin
Version 0.1.5  
Status: Beta

Shell scripts for the centralized management of WordPress.
Intended to be kept as simple as possible for maximum legibility.
These tools provide maintenance and workflow functions.

This project is a dependency of [dowp](https://gitlab.com/neilscudder/dowp), deploying WordPress on Digitalocean.

Dependencies:
* Ubuntu Linux >= 16.04
* [wp-cli](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli)
* [git-auto-deploy](https://github.com/olipo186/Git-Auto-Deploy)
* [restic](https://github.com/restic/restic)

For twitter notifications:
* [tweet.sh](https://github.com/piroor/tweet.sh)
* [markov-sentence-generator](https://github.com/hrs/markov-sentence-generator)
* [pagres-cli](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pageres-cli)

## Installation
Clone this repo and add it to your path.
```
git clone git@gitlab.com:neilscudder/wp-admin.git
```
Add this line to your `~/.bashrc`:
```
export PATH="${PATH}:/path/to/wp-admin"
```
The `.bashrc` is loaded each time you login to Ubuntu but to load it now, run:
```
source .bashrc
```

## SSH Configuration
If you have provisioned your droplet with [dowp](https://gitlab.com/neilscudder/dowp), it will have already set up the ssh config and authorized your key, so you can skip this part.

To use these scripts and avoid entering a password every time, you must export your public ssh key to the server you're targeting.
You will also need to setup an  alias for your host as shown below. See [Digitalocean's ssh key tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys-on-ubuntu-1804).

Host configuration in your local `~/.ssh/config`:
```
Host clientsite
    HostName 10.1.1.1
    Port 22
    User dev
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```
Enter the same info for every site you intend to maintain, with a nifty shortname (Host) for convenience and legibility. Then you can access your servers over ssh, even with custom ports, like this: `ssh clientsite` üòç

## Usage
Each script will print usage instructions if run without arguments.  
These commands each apply to a remote WordPress install.

Backup and Restore:
* [wordpress-backup](https://gitlab.com/neilscudder/wp-admin/blob/master/wordpress-backup) - Export the db and/or rsync the webroot to back them up locally. Optionally sync those backups to a restic repository.
* [wordpress-deleteAll](https://gitlab.com/neilscudder/wp-admin/blob/master/wordpress-deleteAll) - Delete all posts.
* [wordpress-permissions](https://gitlab.com/neilscudder/wp-admin/blob/master/wordpress-permissions) - Set file and folder permissions.
* [wordpress-restore](https://gitlab.com/neilscudder/wp-admin/blob/master/wordpress-restore) - Restore from local backup or git repo.

Deploying from git:
* [gad-add-host](https://gitlab.com/neilscudder/wp-admin/blob/master/gad-add-host) - Add a host to the git-auto-deploy configuration file.
* [gad-deploy-post](https://gitlab.com/neilscudder/wp-admin/blob/master/gad-deploy-post) - Runs after git-auto-deploy, rsyncs the repo from `/var/repos` to host.

Twitter Notifications:
* [notify](https://gitlab.com/neilscudder/wp-admin/blob/master/notify) - Send a tweet notification.

OS-Admin
* [os-authorize](https://gitlab.com/neilscudder/wp-admin/blob/master/os-authorize) - Authorize ssh keys for user on remote server.
* [os-update](https://gitlab.com/neilscudder/wp-admin/blob/master/os-update) - Update server software and reboot.
