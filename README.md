# wp-admin

Shell scripts for the centralized mamagement of WordPress. Intended to be kept as simple as possible for maximum legibility. These tools provide maintenance and workflow functions.

* wp-cli
* apt-get
* bash
* ssh
* ubuntu
* WordPress

## Status

Proof-of-concept. The text below is being adapted from another article.

## <a name="maintenance"></a> Maintenance

Each plugin added to WordPress slows down every uncached page view in WordPress, therefore:

* No plugins will be used for development or maintenance on a live site.

Maintenance will be handled via the terminal from a central WordPress management server ($5 droplet at Digitalocean). This server will contain maintenance logs and database backups for all sites.

The same configuration should run on a Mac, (possibly Windows 10 with bash) and offers the developers some powerful tools and shortcuts. These scripts will be packaged into a git repo so we can share them.

SSH is very flexible, and with the right scripts we can enable push-button controls to perform normal actions. This Android app lets you assign ssh commands to buttons. I use it to check the Gull inventory update log. [Far Commander](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.far.sshcommander).


#### <a name="ssh"></a> SSH Configuration

In order to avoid entering a password every time you want to run one of these scripts you must export your public key to the server you're targeting. [Digitalocean's ssh key tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys--2)

Host configuration in your local `~/.ssh/config`:

```
Host clientsite
        HostName www.clientsite.com
        Port 22
        User dev
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```
Enter the same info for every site you intend to maintain, with a nifty shortname (Host) for convenience and legibility. Then you can access your servers over ssh, even with custom ports, like this: `ssh clientsite` üòç


#### <a name="updates"></a> Updates

Critical core updates automatically installed by WordPress itself **are disabled** because the web server does not have write access to its own codebase. We can update the core and plugins using WP-CLI, or by merging updated code to master.

You can call the update script below using that same shortname: `wordpress-update clientsite` and pass it straight through to SSH (it becomes the variable $1):
```
#!/bin/bash
args="--path=/var/www/html --ssh=$1"
wp $args core version
wp $args core update
wp $args core update-db
wp $args plugin update --all
exit 0
```

This is how it runs:

```
neil@wp-admin:~$ wordpress-update clientsite
4.7.3
Success: WordPress is up to date.
Success: WordPress database already at latest db version 38590.

neil@wp-admin:~$
```

TODO:
* test for update failure
* how to roll back a failed update
* commit and push to master after updates


#### <a name="clone"></a> Clone Database

To copy the live database to the staging environment and update all url's with the staging site port, there is a simple script that uses WP-CLI. 

```
#!/bin/bash
echo "Clone live db to staging, search and replace urls, and flush cache."
read -p "Are you sure? " -n 1 -r
echo    # (optional) move to a new line
if [[ $REPLY =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]
then
        wp --path='/var/www/html' db export /var/www/swap.sql
        wp --path='/var/www/staging' db import /var/www/swap.sql
        wp --path='/var/www/staging' search-replace 'dev.clientsite.com' 'dev.clientsite.com:2001' --skip-columns=guid
        wp --path='/var/www/staging' cache flush
        echo "https://dev.clientsite.com:2001 is now up to date with the live db."
fi
exit 0
```

This is what happens when you run that script:

```
dev@web:~/bin$ clonedb
Clone live db to staging, search and replace urls, and flush cache.
Are you sure? y
Success: Exported to '/var/www/swap.sql'.
Success: Imported from '/var/www/swap.sql'.
[mess of sql output]
Success: Made 147 replacements.
Success: The cache was flushed.
https://dev.clientsite.com:2001 is now up to date with the live db.
dev@web:~/bin$
```

You now have an exact and current copy of the live site running on the same web server as the live site, providing the most accurate testing environment possible.


#### <a name="backups"></a> Backups

The codebase is backed up each time it is changed in the repository. The upload directory is backed up 4 times each month with the whole droplet by Digitalocean. More frequent droplet backups are best achieved with a second droplet rsync'd to the live one ever hour or so. [TODO: add that code here]

Droplet snapshots should be manually taken on a regular basis just in case more than a month passes without someone noticing that a site has been hacked and all the automated backups have been overwritten. TODO: use the digitalocean API to do this programmatically on a schedule.

The database backups are written to the management server twice daily‚Äã, easily accomplished with wp-cli. [See the [SSH](#ssh) section for hosts configuration]

```
#!/bin/bash
cd ~/db-backups
echo "Rotate backups"
mv -v ${1}.4.sql.gz ${1}.5.sql.gz
mv -v ${1}.3.sql.gz ${1}.4.sql.gz
mv -v ${1}.2.sql.gz ${1}.3.sql.gz
mv -v ${1}.1.sql.gz ${1}.2.sql.gz
mv -v ${1}.sql.gz ${1}.1.sql.gz
echo "Export db from WordPress..."
# Setup ssh hosts first in ~/.ssh/config
args="--path=/var/www/html --ssh=$1"
wp $args db export - > "${1}.sql"
# Zip it up
gzip -vf ${1}.sql
exit 0
```

And the output of that script:
```
neil@wp-admin:~$ wordpress-backup clientsite
Rotate backups
'clientsite.4.sql.gz' -> 'clientsite.5.sql.gz'
'clientsite.3.sql.gz' -> 'clientsite.4.sql.gz'
'clientsite.2.sql.gz' -> 'clientsite.3.sql.gz'
'clientsite.1.sql.gz' -> 'clientsite.2.sql.gz'
'clientsite.sql.gz' -> 'clientsite.1.sql.gz'
Export db from WordPress...
clientsite.sql:        90.1% -- replaced with clientsite.sql.gz
neil@wp-admin:~$
```

TODO add section on restoring backups, downloading backups
