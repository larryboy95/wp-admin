# wp-admin

Shell scripts for the centralized management of WordPress. Intended to be kept as simple as possible for maximum legibility. These tools provide maintenance and workflow functions.

Packages and prerequisites:

* wp-cli
* apt-get
* bash
* ssh
* ubuntu
* WordPress

#### Status

Beta. Tested on Ubuntu 16.04 with WordPress 4.7.3.

#### Goals

* Intended for use by web developers as an aid in development and to help learn terminal server administration

* Every write function must be preceeded by a backup and offer an undo

* Each script should produce machine readable output wherever relevant so scripts can be used together

* Each script should be portable enough for cron


#### <a name="install"></a> Installation

Create a $5 Ubuntu 16.04 droplet at Digitalocean. This droplet will serve as your administration workspace, storing all your SSH keys and database backups. Make sure it is secure.

Clone this repo to your home dir, rename the directory to `bin`. The directory `~/bin` is in your PATH which means you can now run the scripts from anywhere, like `wordpress-backup personal`


#### <a name="ssh"></a> SSH Configuration

To run these scripts remotely and avoid entering a password every time you must export your public key to the server you're targeting. [Digitalocean's ssh key tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys--2)

Host configuration in your local `~/.ssh/config`:

```
Host clientsite
        HostName www.clientsite.com
        Port 22
        User dev
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```
Enter the same info for every site you intend to maintain, with a nifty shortname (Host) for convenience and legibility. Then you can access your servers over ssh, even with custom ports, like this: `ssh clientsite` üòç


#### <a name="how"></a> How It Works

You call each script below using that same Host: `wordpress-update clientsite` and pass it straight through to SSH (it becomes the variable $1). For example:
```
#!/bin/bash
wp --path=/var/www/html --ssh=$1 plugin update --all
```

This is how it runs:

```
neil@wp-admin:~$ wordpress-update clientsite

`wordpress-backup HOST MODE`  Mode is one of `manual`, `daily`, `hourly`, or `tmp` and each writes to a different directory (configured in script) No more than 8 backups are kept for each host/mode.

```

`wordpress-remote HOST "COMMAND COMMAND ..."` is for running any arbitrary wp-cli command on the remote host. Use with caution.

`wordpress-list` reads the file `~/.ssh/config` to find WordPress hosts. It should verify the connection to each and output a list of hosts that can be used in batch scripts to run `wordpress-update` or `wordpress-backup` programatically. It's a work-in-progress.
